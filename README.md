Applying a Natural Language Processing Model with Spark

## What does our project consist of?
Ways to process textual data involve applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques along with the construction of Machine Learning models to classify comments, where various testimonials about movies are collected and categorized as either negative or positive. The applied NLP techniques aimed to make the comments more comprehensible for the machine.

## How shall we do?

Data Preprocessing:

Removal of special characters using regular expressions.
Elimination of stopwords.
Tokenization: Applying the concept of tokenization; Tokenization is the process of dividing a sentence into individual parts or tokens, usually into unique words, and removing words that won't contribute to the analysis.

Bag of Words Concept: Aim to count the terms of our vocabulary.

Construction of a Pipeline: Creating a pipeline to execute all steps of our project seamlessly.

Adjustment using Decision Tree and Random Forest:
Fine-tuning on top of a decision tree and also a random forest.
